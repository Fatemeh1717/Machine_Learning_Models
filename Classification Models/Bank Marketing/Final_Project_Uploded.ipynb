    "### Introduction\n",
    "In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, based on a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples of classification problems are assigning a given email to the \"spam\" or \"non-spam\" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the Bank Marketing Dataset from Kaggle to build a model to predict whether someone is going to make a deposit or not depending on some attributes. We wiill try to build 4 models using different algorithm Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. After building each model we will evalueate them and compare which model are the best for our case. We will then try to optimze our model by tuning the hyper paramters of the model by using GridSearch. Lastly, we will save the prediction result from our dataset and then save our model for reussability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start we will load some basic libraries such as Pandas and NumPy and then make some configuration to some of those libraries."
